<p class=MsoNormal><b>Heat flow</b> - is the thermal energy rate (heat)
transferred a given surface.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Thermal Resistance</b> - the resistance of a thermal
system (object) or that cross section is defined as the ratio between the
length of the section and the thermal conductivity of the material of which it is made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Conductivity </b>- thermal conductivity is a physical
quantity that measures the ability of a substance to conduct heat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Thermodynamics</b> - thermodynamics is the branch of physics 
that studies the causes and effects of changes in temperature, pressure and volume - 
and other fundamental thermodynamic quantities in less general cases - on physical 
systems at the macroscopic scale. Roughly, heat means "energy" in transit, and dynamics 
relates to "movement". So, in essence thermodynamics studies the movement of energy and 
how energy creates motion. Historically, thermodynamics developed by the need to increase 
the efficiency of the first steam engines, being essentially an experimental science, which 
concerns only the macroscopic properties or large scale matter and energy.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Thermal equilibrium - zero law of thermodynamics</b> - When two systems A and B are in thermal 
equilibrium with another C system then the systems A and B are in thermal equilibrium with each other.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Variation of internal energy - 1st law of thermodynamics</b> - The energy transferred between a 
system and not isolated neighborhood, such as heat, work, or radiation, it is equal to the internal energy change of the system.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Entropy - 2nd law of thermodynamics</b> - Spontaneous processes occur to increase the disorder (entropy) of the system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Temperature</b> - the temperature can be seen as the property that determines when an object is in thermal equilibrium with another object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Thermal expansion</b> - most of the solid and liquid undergoes an expansion when its temperature 
rises, this expansion depends on its crystalline structure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Heat</b> - heat is the heat energy in transit due to a temperature difference between the bodies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Specific heat</b> - the heat used by the substance only to vary its temperature, without changing its physical state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Latent heat</b> - When the heat exchanged is used by the substance to change physical state with no temperature change and 
under constant pressure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Heat Transfer Processes</b> - Heat transfer is the hottest to the coldest. Can occur in three ways:</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Conduction:</b> Heat transfer occurs, the particle particle, only through molecular agitation and 
clashes between the middle molecules;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Convection:</b> transmission through molecular agitation and the medium itself or parts of this 
middle movement;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Radiation:</b> Heat transfer by radiation does not need a material between the two points to occur. 
The transmission is made by the photon transfer between two bodies. Only happens if a body can "see" each other. It occurs in both directions, but 
the balance is from the hotter to the colder body.</p>
